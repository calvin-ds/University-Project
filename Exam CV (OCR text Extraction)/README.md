This is the University project which i done as a part of Applied data science course.

This was a group project where me and my frineds where given the task to extract Exam result contents from an exam sheet using camera and successfully input them into a database using text extraction by TrOCR.

By the end of the project we where successfully able to extract relevant contents from an exam sheet which includes:

* Name of the student 
* Student ID
* Exam score for each question
* Total score

The extarcted contents where then later added into a database.
